<h4 id="example1-group-work-in-education"><strong>example1. Group Work in Education</strong></h4>
<hr>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>The article introduces the topic of</strong> group work in education. The writer states that group work is highly beneficial for students. However, the lecture disagrees with this.</p>
<p><strong>Body 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, the writer mentions that group work helps students improve their communication skills by interacting with classmates.
<strong>However,</strong> the lecture argues that in many groups, only one or two students dominate the discussion. As a result, quieter students do not have enough opportunities to speak. Therefore, their communication skills do not actually improve.</p>
<p><strong>Body 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next,</strong> the writer mentions that group work helps students improve their communication skills by interacting with classmates.
<strong>On the other hand,</strong> the lecture argues that in many groups, only one or two students dominate the discussion. As a result, quieter students do not have enough opportunities to speak. Therefore, their communication skills do not actually improve.</p>
<p><strong>Body 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally,</strong> the writer argues that group work prepares students for teamwork in their future careers.
<strong>In contrast,</strong> the lecture explains that most real workplaces evaluate <em>(not evaluates)</em> individuals rather than groups. The lecturer also notes that students often rely on others, which does not reflect real professional <em>responsibilities</em>.</p>
<p><strong>conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> while the article presents group work as an effective learning method, the lecturer challenges this view by providing counterarguments <em>regarding</em> unequal participation, misinformation, and unrealistic preparation for future jobs.</p>

<h4 id="expample2-solar-energy"><strong>expample2. Solar Energy</strong></h4>
<hr>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>The article introduces the topic of</strong> solar energy as an <em>alternative</em> energy source. <strong>The writer states that</strong> solar power is an effective solution to energy problems. <strong>However,</strong> the lecture disagrees <em>with</em> this.</p>
<p><strong>Body 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>First,</strong> the writer mentions that solar energy is environmentally friendly because it does not produce air pollution.
<strong>However,</strong> the lecture argues that manufacturing solar panels causes environmental damage. The lecturer explains that toxic chemicals are used <em>during production</em>.  These chemicals can <em>pollute</em> water and soil.</p>
<p><strong>Body 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next,</strong> the writer states that using solar energy can reduce electricity costs in the <em>long run</em>. <strong>On the other hand,</strong> the lecture points out that the initial cost is <em>extremely</em> expensive. The lecturer adds that many people cannot afford this cost, so they never benefit financially.</p>
<p><strong>Body 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally,</strong> the writer argues that solar energy is reliable and stable.
<strong>In contrast,</strong> the lecture explains that sol<strong>a</strong>r power depends heavily on weather conditions. The lecturer gives an example that solar panels cannot generate enough electricity on cloudy or rainy days.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> while the article presents solar energy as a practical option, the lecturer challenges this view by discussing environmental harm, high costs, and unstable energy production.</p>

<h4 id="example3-online-learning"><strong>example3. Online learning</strong></h4>
<hr>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>The article introduces the topic of</strong> online learning. The writer states that online education is more effective than traditional classroom learning. <strong>However,</strong> the lecture disagrees with this.</p>
<p><strong>Body 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>First,</strong> the writer mentions that online learning provides flexibility in time and location.
<strong>However,</strong> the lecture argues that this flexibility often leads to procrastination. The lecturer explains that many students delay studying because there is no fixed schedule. As a result, they fall behind in their courses.</p>
<p><strong>Body 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next,</strong>  the writer states that online courses offer access to a wide variety of lerning <em>m<strong>a</strong>terials</em>.
<strong>On the other hand,</strong> the lecture points out that students may feel overwhelmed by too much information. The lecturer adds that some matericals are unreliable, which can confuse learners.</p>
<p><strong>Body 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally,</strong> the writer argues that online learning helps students become independent learners.
<strong>In contrast,</strong> the lecture explains that many students <em>lack</em> <em>self-discipline</em>. The lecturer notes that without direct <em>supervision</em> from teachers, students often fail to stay motivated.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> while the article presents online learning as highly effective, the lecturer challenges this view by addressing issues related to time management, information overload, and <em>lack of</em> motivation.</p>

<h4 id="example4-zoo-conservation"><strong>example4. Zoo Conservation</strong></h4>
<hr>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>The article introduces the topic of</strong> zoos and animal conservation. The writer states that zoos help protect endangered species. <strong>However,</strong> the lecture disagrees with this.</p>
<p><strong>Body 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>First,</strong> the writer mentions that zoos provide environments for endangered animals.
<strong>However,</strong> the lecture argues that animals often suffer from stress in captivity. The lecturer explains that limited space prevents animals from behaving naturally. As a result, their phisical and mental health may <em>decline</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Body 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next,</strong> the writer states that zoos support breeding programs.
<strong>On the other hand,</strong> the lecture poins out that animals raised in zoos struggle to survive in the wild. The lecturer adds that <em>they lack</em> necessary hunting and survival skills.</p>
<p><strong>Body 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally,</strong> the writer argues that zoos educate the public wildlife protection.
<strong>In contrast,</strong> the lecture explains that documentaries and online resources can educate people more <em>effectively</em>. The lecturer notes that these methods reach a wilder audience.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> while the article claims that zoos <em>contribute to</em> consevation, the lecturer challenges this view by discussing animal stress, poor survival skill, and limited educational value.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>The article introduces the topic of</strong> handwritten note-taking. The writer states that writing notes by hand improves learning. <strong>However,</strong> the lecture disagrees with this.</p>
<p><strong>Body 1</strong></p>

<p><strong>Body 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next,</strong> the writer <strong>states</strong> that handwriting helps students concentrate.
<strong>On the other hand,</strong> the lecture <strong>points out</strong> that many students type faster than they write. The lecture adds that typing allows them to recored more information.</p>
<p><strong>Body 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally,</strong> the writer <strong>argues</strong> that handwriteen notes reduce distractions.
<strong>In contrast,</strong> the lecture explains that <strong>disciplined</strong> students can avoid distractions even when using digital devices.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>The article introduces the topic of</strong> space exploration. The writer <strong>states</strong> that investing in space programs benefits society. <strong>However</strong>, the lecture <strong>disgrees</strong> with this.</p>
<p><strong>Body1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fisrt</strong>, the writer <strong>mentions</strong> that space exploration leads to technological innovation.
<strong>However</strong>, the lecture <strong>argues</strong> that many technologies developed for space have limited practical use on Earth. The lecturer explains that they are often too expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Body2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>, the writer <strong>states</strong> that space programs <em>inspire</em> young people to study science.
<strong>On the other hand</strong>, the lecture <strong>points out</strong> that inspiration alone does not guarantee long-term interest. The lecturer adds that many students lose motivation due to difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>Body3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, the writer argues that space exploration <em><strong>helps</strong></em> <em>solve</em> global problems.
<strong>In contrast</strong>, the lecture <strong>explains</strong> that space programs require <em>enormous</em> funding. The lecturer notes that this money could adress urgent social issues.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, while the article supports space exploration, the lecturer challenges this view by emphasizing limited applications, weak motivation effects, and high costs.</p>

<p><strong>As A mentioned</strong>, it is true that studying in one's home country is more affordable and comfortable. However, this view fails to consider that students may miss valuable opportunities for personal growth.</p>
<p><strong>I agree more with</strong> B's opinion, <em>because</em> it better reflects the importance of global awareness.</p>
<p><strong>To build <em>on</em> B's idea</strong>, my personal belief is that living in another culture improves <em>adaptability</em>. For example, students who study abroad often become more independent and confident.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, I believe that studying abroad is the better choice.</p>
