## **wilderness**
---

I personally believe that wilderness should be protected from human activity.

As Andrew mentions, it is true that human life in some regions heavily depends on hunting specific species in wildlife. However, this view fails to consider the fact that this type of lifestyle is no longer sustainable in the modern world.

I agree more with Kelly’s opinion, because it better reflects the importance of protecting endangered species.

To build on Kelly’s idea, my personal belief is that once a species becomes extinct, it can negatively affect the entire ecosystem. For example, animals that depend on that species for food may also struggle to survive. As a result, the balance of nature can easily collapse.

In conclusion, protecting wilderness from human activity leads to better outcomes for the environment as a whole.

## **Meal-kit services**

---

I personally believe that meal-kit websites are not a positive trend.

As Andrew mentions, it is true that this kind of service is helpful for younger generations or people who struggle to cook. However, this view fails to consider the fact that meal-kit services do not encourage users to develop basic cooking skills.

I agree more with Claire, because her opinion better reflects the negative impact on the environment.

To build on Claire’s point, my personal belief is that using meal-kit services is costly. For example, these services are often more expensive than buying ingredients at a supermarket because they include packaging and delivery fees. As a result, relying on meal-kit services can become a financial burden for users.

In conclusion, meal-kit services have negative impacts on both the environment and consumers.

## **Fast fashion**

I personally believe that the popularity of fast fashion is a positive trend.

As Claire mentions, it is true that fast fashion may harm the environment. However, this view fails to consider the fact that many fast fashion clothes are reused or recycled rather than immediately discarded.

I agree more with Andrew’s idea, because it better reflects the financial benefits of fast fashion.

To build on Andrew’s point, my personal belief is that fast fashion can also offer environmental benefits. For example, many fast fashion brands now produce clothing using recycled or reusable materials. As a result, fast fashion can contribute to a more sustainable society.

In conclusion, fast fashion provides positive impacts on both individuals and society.

## **Working from home**

---

I personally believe that working from home is beneficial.

As Claire mentions, it is true that employees may struggle to communicate with their coworkers. However, this view fails to consider the fact that, thanks to technological development, there are many effective ways to communicate in real time.

I agree more with Andrew’s idea, because it better reflects the flexibility of remote work.

To build on Andrew’s point, my personal belief is that working from home reduces financial burdens. For example, since commuting is no longer necessary, transportation costs such as parking fees and train fares are reduced.

In conclusion, working from home offers both better work-life balance and financial benefits.

## **Artificial Intelligence**

---


I personally believe that the increasing use of artificial intelligence is a positive development for society.

As Claire mentions, it is true that AI has the potential to replace human labor. However, this view fails to consider the fact that AI also creates new job opportunities and allows humans to focus on more important tasks.

I agree more with Andrew’s idea, because it better reflects the long-term benefits of technological progress and its positive impact on society as a whole.

To build on Andrew’s point, my personal belief is that AI significantly improves efficiency in various fields. For example, in business and healthcare, AI can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, which helps professionals make better decisions. As a result, humans can focus more on creative and interpersonal work that machines cannot easily replace.

In conclusion, although AI may replace certain jobs, it ultimately benefits society by enhancing productivity and creating new opportunities.

The article mentions the topic of ingenious weapon called a “burning mirror” used in ancient times. The Greeks used this weapon to protect them by causing Roman ships to catch fire. According to the article, the use of this weapon seems unreal. However, the lecture clearly disagrees with this claim. 

First, the article mentions the fact that it was technologically impossible to make such a precise and a large sheet of copper back then. However, the professor states that they might have used smaller pieces of copper. By collecting these tiny pieces together, they could use them as a weapon. 

Second, the writer claims that it took long time for wooden objects to catch fire. According to the article, it took thirty minutes and this does not seem effective. On the other hand, the professor says that some combustible materials such as pitch were used to make Roman ships. Consequently, this made the use of the weapon reasonable.

Finally, the article argues that the Greeks already had flame arrows, so there was no need to use a burning mirror. In contrast, the professor notes that flame arrows were easy for Romans to detect and avoid. The burning mirror, however, could start fires silently and unexpectedly. This made “burning mirror” an effective weapon. 

In conclusion, while the writer does not believe the use of “burning mirror”, the lecture challenges this view by discussing some reasonable counterarguments.
