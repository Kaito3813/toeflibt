### **usage**

---
#### **example1. Online Learning**
---

**The article introduces the topic of** online learning. The writer *states* that online education is more effective than traditional classroom learning. **However,** the lecture **clearly** *disagrees with* this claim.

**First,** the writer *mentions* that online learning <u>provides flexibility in time and location</u>. According to the article, students can study <u>whenever and wherever they want.</u> **However**, the lecture *argues* that this flexibility often causes serious <u>procrastination.</u> The lecturer *explains* that without fixed schedules, many students postpone studying until deadlines approach. As a result, they feel overwhelmed and perform poorly on exams and assignments.

**Next,** the article *states* that online courses offer access to a wide variety of learning materials. The writer *claims* that students can choose resources that best fit their learning styles. **On the other hand,** the lecture *points out* that too many materials can actually reduce learning efficiency. The lecturer adds that some online sources are unreliable or inaccurate. Consequently, students may become confused and misunderstand important concepts.

**Finally,** the writer *argues* that online learning helps students become independent learners. **In contrast,** the lecture *explains* that many students lack self-discipline. The lecturer *notes* that without direct supervision from instructors, students often lose motivation. **Over time,** this leads to low course completion rates.

**In conclusion,** **while the article <u>*presents*** online learning as highly effective,</u> the lecturer challenges this view by emphasizing **problems related to** procrastination, unreliable materials, and lack of self-discipline.

---

#### **example2. Solar Energy**
---

**The article introduces the topic o**f solar energy. The writer *claims* that solar power is an ideal solution to current energy problems. **However, the lecture disagrees with this position.**

**First,** the writer *states* that solar energy is <u>environmentally friendly</u> because it produces no air pollution. According to the article, this <u>makes solar power a clean energy source.</u> **However,** the lecture *points* out that producing solar panels harms the environment. The lecturer *explains* that toxic chemicals used during manufacturing can contaminate nearby soil and water. **As a result,** solar energy is <u>not as environmentally safe as the article suggests.</u>

**Next,** the article *argues* that solar energy reduces electricity costs in the long term. The writer *claims* that homeowners can save money over time. **On the other hand,** the lecture *explains* that the initial installation cost is extremely high. The lecturer *adds that* many families cannot afford this investment. **Therefore,** most people never experience the financial benefits described in the article.

**Finally,** the writer *asserts* that solar energy is reliable due to abundant sunlight. **In contrast,** the lecture *explains* that solar power heavily depends on weather conditions. The lecturer *notes* that energy production decreases significantly on cloudy or rainy days. <u>This makes solar energy an unstable power source.</u>

**In conclusion,** **while the article** promotes solar energy as practical and eco-friendly, the lecturer **challenges this view by discussing** environmental damage, high costs, and unreliable energy production.

---

#### **example3. Group Work in Education**
---

**The article introduces the topic of** group work in education. The writer *argues* that group projects improve students’ academic performance. **However, the lecture disagrees with this argument.**

**First,** the article *states* that <u>group work encourages students to share ideas and perspectives.</u> According to the writer, this interaction improves understanding. **However,** the lecture *argues* that group discussions are often dominated by a small number of students. The lecturer *explains* that quieter students rarely participate. **As a result,** they gain little educational benefit.

**Next,** the writer *claims* that group work prepares students for teamwork in their future careers. **On the other hand,** the lecture *points out* that most workplaces evaluate employees individually. The lecturer *adds* that responsibilities in real jobs are clearly defined. Therefore, group projects do not accurately reflect professional environments.

**Finally,** the article *claims* that group work increases student motivation. **In contrast,** the lecture *explains* that <u>some students rely too heavily on others.</u> The lecturer *notes* that hardworking students may feel frustrated. Over time, this can reduce overall motivation.

**In conclusion, while the article** supports group work, the lecturer challenges its effectiveness **by emphasizing** unequal participation, unrealistic preparation, and reduced motivation.

---
#### **example4. Zoo Conservation**

**The article introduces the topic of** zoos and animal conservation. The writer claims that zoos play an important role in protecting endangered species. **However, the lecture disagrees with this view.**

**First,** the writer *states* that zoos provide safe environments for animals. According to the article, animals are protected from predators and starvation. **However,** the lecture *explains* that animals often experience severe stress in captivity. The lecturer notes that limited space prevents animals from behaving naturally. **As a result,** their physical and mental health declines.

**Next,** the article *argues* that zoos support breeding programs for endangered species. **On the other hand,** the lecture *points out* that animals raised in zoos struggle to survive in the wild. The lecturer *explains* that these animals lack essential survival skills, such as hunting and avoiding predators. Consequently, many released animals fail to survive.

**Finally,** the writer *claims* that zoos educate the public about wildlife protection. **In contrast,** the lecture *argues* that documentaries and online resources are more effective. These methods reach a wider audience and provide more detailed information.

**In conclusion,** **while the article** praises zoos for conservation, the lecturer challenges this view **by discussing** animal stress, poor survival skills, and limited educational value.
